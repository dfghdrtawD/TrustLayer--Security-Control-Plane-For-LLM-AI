# RapidAPI Spotlights (Enterprise)

## Spotlight 1 — AI Control Plane
TrustLayer AI is the control-plane layer that governs AI behavior across prompts, agents, and toolchains.

## Spotlight 2 — Prevent Prompt Injection
Stop jailbreaks and system-prompt extraction with verdicts you can enforce: low/medium/high.

## Spotlight 3 — Contract Testing (Policy Enforcement)
Run `/test/run` to block prompt leaks, PII, and tool-hijack patterns. Treat AI behavior like a contract.

## Spotlight 4 — CI Enforcement
Use the TrustLayer GitHub Action to fail builds automatically when prompts become unsafe.

## Spotlight 5 — Enterprise Roadmap
Drift alerts → Incident brake → Audit exports. TrustLayer becomes mandatory infrastructure for autonomous AI.
